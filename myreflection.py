In my version, I accidentally defined the greet() function twice, which is unnecessary and can cause confusion. The solution defines it only once and calls it multiple times.
I directly printed greet("Cesar") at the top. The solution avoids hardcoding values and instead demonstrates using a list and looping through it.
We both used a for loop, but the solution includes more helpful comments and better formatting, making the logic easier to follow. My function was shorter but less documented.
The solution also prints the results using a formatted f-string, while mine used multiple print statements or less clean formatting.
An f-string is a way to embed expressions or variables directly inside a string. 
ex: x = 3
y = 4
print(f"The sum of x and y is {x + y}")
# Output: "The sum of x and y is 7"
F-strings make code cleaner, easier to read, and eliminate messy concatenation
A for loop is used to iterate over each element in a list. Lists are ordered collections of items like names.
